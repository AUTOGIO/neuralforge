# Debugging Workflow

## Debugging Steps
1. **Check Logs**: Always check application logs first
2. **Verify Configuration**: Ensure all config files are correct
3. **Test Dependencies**: Verify all required packages are installed
4. **Check Environment**: Ensure environment variables are set
5. **Test Isolation**: Test components in isolation

## Common Issues
- **PostgreSQL Connection**: Check database credentials and connection
- **Apple Silicon Detection**: Verify architecture detection
- **Memory Issues**: Check for memory leaks and large objects
- **File Permissions**: Ensure proper file system permissions
- **Network Issues**: Check internet connectivity for external APIs

## Debugging Tools
- Use `rich` for beautiful debug output
- Include verbose logging options
- Use `pdb` for interactive debugging
- Include performance profiling
- Use memory profiling tools

## Error Reporting
- Include stack traces in error messages
- Provide context about what was happening
- Include system information in error reports
- Suggest possible solutions
- Log errors for analysis

## Testing Debug Scenarios
- Test error conditions
- Verify error handling works
- Test recovery mechanisms
- Include stress testing
- Test edge cases
