# Automation Workflow Rules

## n8n Integration
- Create JSON workflow templates in `scripts/n8n_workflows.json`
- Use standard n8n node types and parameters
- Include error handling and retry logic
- Document workflow purpose and usage
- Test workflows before deployment

## Node-RED Integration
- Create JSON flow templates in `scripts/node_red_flows.json`
- Use standard Node-RED node types
- Include proper wiring and data flow
- Add debug nodes for troubleshooting
- Document flow configuration

## Raycast Commands
- Create command templates in `scripts/raycast_commands.json`
- Use proper Raycast command structure
- Include command descriptions and preferences
- Test commands in Raycast environment
- Document command usage and parameters

## Workflow Best Practices
- Keep workflows simple and focused
- Use descriptive names and descriptions
- Include error handling and logging
- Test workflows thoroughly
- Document workflow dependencies

## Integration Patterns
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper error handling
- Include logging and monitoring
- Test integration points
- Document integration requirements
